# Databases

### What is a Database?
A collection of data that is stored somewhere. There are three types of "databases".

1. **Flat file:** stores data in plain files such as; csv, json etc. Very simple, usually used in specific scenarios.
2. **Non-Relational Database (NoSQL):** stores information without structure. It is usually faster, flexible, easy to use as there is no structure.
3. **Relational Database (SQL):** stores data like spreadsheets, there are columns and rows. It links data across tables using keys (details below).

Uses keys to navigate/link the data, they create the relationship among the database. There different kinds of keys, but we will only focus on:
- **Primary Key:** a unique column in the table. The values cannot be empty or duplicated as it ensures its uniqueness in the data.
- **Foreign Key:** a column or multiple columns that references (link) two or more tables together.
- **Unique Key:** a unique column or columns in the table. The values can be empty but not duplicated.
