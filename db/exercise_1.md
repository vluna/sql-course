# Exercise 1

## Context

It is inventory time! Your manager wants to know more about some products. They would like to know:
- All the bikes from 2017
- What bikes cost more than $2,000
- The bikes that cost less than $500
- The list of bikes from 2018 that cost more than $1,000 but less than $1,890

After, your manager would really appreciate if you give them a list of employees containing only their first name, last name and phone number. They would like it ordered by their email address. As well, the list of names for all the stores.

## Challenge

Moreover, your manager would be super happy to know how many customers are from California and New York or from Texas with a phone number.
