## Context

You quit your job at the bike store because you saw an opportunity at the local library. You notice that they still use cards for their catalog and you told them that you would like to build a system for them.

The librarians are quite happy that you will do this for them. They tell you that they do not need much, all they need the system to do is:

- View all the books based on an author
- A way to classify books by genre
- Able to view all available books

## Task
