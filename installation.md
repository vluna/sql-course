# Installation

For the purpose of this course, we will be using a couple of different tools:

1. [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/downloads.html) - an interface to start and stop your system to run the DB
2. [Positco](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) - an interface to interact with your Postgres DB
